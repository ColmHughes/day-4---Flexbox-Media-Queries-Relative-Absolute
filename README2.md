A paragraph is just a paragraph of text. You don't need to provide any p tags 
or breaks.

I used semantic `<section>` tags instead of `<div>`

```JavaScript
function multiplication(a,b) {
    if(typeof(a) == "number" && typeof(b) == "number") {
        return a*b;
    } else {
        alert("Error!")
    }
}
```
